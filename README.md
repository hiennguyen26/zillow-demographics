# zillow-demographics

**Introduction:** 
This is Hien's personal project exploring how machine learning and data mining could be applied to world's age old industry - Real Estate.

This repo includes data cleaning processes that integrates demographics data with zillow listings, a classification project that uses KNN, Logistic Regression and SVM to create a model that can classify whether a zillow listing is "flippable" or not. Results aren't truly satisfying (64% accuracy after hyperparameter tuning) but much of it can be blamed for bad training and testing datasets. 

**Exploring Avenues:**
- Image Classfication for finished houses, before the Flipping Classification to add another layer of classification to filter out image datasets. 
- Track DOM->Sold in each zip code to determine city hotness. Quantafiable by home listing and sold. 
- Need a more daily scrape -> Salenium scraping. 
- Scrape reviews of restaurants, shops and amenities to identify new pop ups, decreases, increases in popularity of each zip code.
